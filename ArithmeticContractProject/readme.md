# ArithmeticContract Project

## Overview

This project contains a simple Solidity smart contract named `ArithmeticContract`. 

The contract provides three functions: `isOdd`, `isEven`, and `mostSignificantBit` for performing basic arithmetic operations on unsigned integers.

The contract is written in Solidity and is designed to be deployed on the Arbitrum Network.

## Smart Contract Functions

### 1. `isOdd`

- **Description:** Checks whether a given unsigned integer is an odd number.
- **Input Parameters:** `_number` - an unsigned integer.
- **Returns:** A boolean indicating whether the input number is odd.

### 2. `isEven`

- **Description:** Checks whether a given unsigned integer is an even number.
- **Input Parameters:** `_number` - an unsigned integer.
- **Returns:** A boolean indicating whether the input number is even.

### 3. `mostSignificantBit`

- **Description:** Calculates the position of the most significant bit (MSB) in the binary representation of a given unsigned integer.
- **Input Parameters:** `_number` - an unsigned integer.
- **Returns:** The position of the MSB as an unsigned integer.

## Usage

The contract was deployed on the Arbitrum Sepolia.

You can use tools like Remix for deployment and testing.
